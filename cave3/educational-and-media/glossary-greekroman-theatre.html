<td width="200"><strong>architectural orders</strong></td>
<td>The classification system used to define styles of ancient architecture; most common to ancient Greece are the <strong>Doric</strong>, <strong>Ionic</strong>, and <strong>Corinthian</strong> orders. The three main parts of a temple facade are the steps, the columns, and the entablature. These three elements, in turn, have three parts: three steps (uppermost being the <strong>stylobate</strong>), three parts to a column (normally the base, shaft, and capital), and three parts to an <strong>entablature</strong> (an <strong>architrave</strong>, a <strong>frieze</strong>, and a <strong>cornice</strong>). These architectural elements are further classified by their particular style of design (Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian). The column is normally indicative of the style of each order. Doric order (simple, smooth, round) developed on the Greek mainland and in southern Italy and Sicily by 7th century BC. Ionic (scrolled-shaped decoration) developed in Ionia and on some of the Greek islands by the 6th century BC. Corinthian (elaborate capital with acanthus leaf decorations), used more by Romans than Greeks, emerged late in the 5th century BC. Later variations of these orders by the Romans produced the Roman <strong>Composite</strong> order.</td>
