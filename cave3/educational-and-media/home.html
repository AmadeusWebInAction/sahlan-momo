The <em>Cave 3.0</em> performances are held in opera houses, concert halls and other appointed locations, at festivals and international meetings. The performances are video recorded in HD for an ensuing educational documentary production and live streamed through the <em>Cave 3.0</em> dynamic platform connected to social media and via other partner organisations with large networks to allow remote participants to share the opera in real time. While <em>Cave 3.0</em> will be streamed and documented, key moments will be formatted for broadcast, advertising, cultural and marketing purposes. All content will be archived, edited and tagged to make it accessible to different time zones and for people heading to the <em>Cave 3.0</em> after the live performances.
<span class="color_35">In order to reach a broad global audience, the event will be fully advertised through a multi-media communication strategy involving both traditional and advanced technologies.</span>

<span class="color_35"><em>OPTIONAL</em> — The performance could be accompanied by the<em> Cave 3.0</em> <em>International Colloquium on Art and New Technologies</em> convening artists, academia, and innovative tech industries to take inventory of the relevance, contribution, and envisaged future use and directions of new technologies in the artistic field.</span>
