<em>Cave 3.0</em> is a contemporary multidisciplinary opera in 2 acts, Prelude, 7 scenes, and Epilogue, integrating live performance and holograms in an innovative theatrical language. It is a production depicting the creation and development of human consciousness as perceived and narrated throughout different epics around the world. Each of the seven scenes is framed in a geo-cultural thematic area, portraying a distinct tier of the development of consciousness in each chosen culture, at times addressing and referring to archetypes drawn from traditional lore and, occasionally, quoting verses clothed into their respective theatrical forms.
<em>Cave 3.0</em> is a unique artistic endeavour in that it integrates live performance and holograms into a new whole advanced theatricality: the stage project combines live performers, music, singers, and dancers alongside hologram imagery as an integral part of the stage language. The use of holograms, combined with live performances, challenges the definition and the boundaries between film and theatre, between matter and antimatter, between sensory perception and illusion and aims to advance both the stage's aesthetic discourse and its fruition. <em>Cave 3.0</em> aims to create an innovative operatic language using the most advanced technology and stage production to share the most ancient and deeply-rooted human myths. <strong><small>{open}</small></strong>

The title borrows from Plato’s 'Allegory of the Cave' (<em>The Republic</em>, Book VII) exemplifying the development of human consciousness as it appears through various myths and cultures.
The journey unwinds in a sevenfold dimensional paradigm<a style="font-size: 1rem;">1</a>&nbsp;— a numerical archetype that has persisted from antiquity to the present in almost all epochs and cultures throughout the ages —&nbsp;here casted in a three-layered cube&nbsp;stage-setting — the&nbsp;<a href="http://cave3.org/the-cube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradigmatic Matrix</a>, &nbsp;the&nbsp;Staged&nbsp;Cube<a style="font-size: 1rem;">2</a>&nbsp; of fig.&nbsp;<small>1 </small>&nbsp;— on which the operatic action unwraps, typifying the higher, the medial and the lower planes of manifestation, respectively, the esoteric, the mesoteric&nbsp; and the exoteric consciousness, and other correlated three-layered models<a>3</a>, embodied in the corresponding vertical planes, and unfolding the Narrative.
1. The sevenfold paradigm is a model of reality shared by many traditions and is to be found, among others, in cosmological, philosophical, anthropological, mythical and physical systems. Some of its most familiar correlations are, to name a few, the 7 steps of creation/emanation; the prismatic refraction of white light into 7 colours, the musical scale, the week-span, the chakras system, showing a deep-rooted origin, ostensibly reflecting a universal archetypal paradigm in human consciousness.
2. The three vertical planes&nbsp;stand&nbsp;respectively for the esoteric, the&nbsp;mesoteric&nbsp;and the exoteric consciousness, but also for the intellectual-emotional-moving human centres, the spirit-soul-body triad, the thesis-synthesis-antithesis dialectical moments, the Etz haChayim, the Trinity, the Gunas trichotomy, etc., and here also for the visual-musical-textual semiotic fields of the opera, and its aria-chorus-recitativo main formal elements.
3. In this context the Cube represents a complex symbolic and metaphorical element, it is the Manifestation, the Earthly realm, the corner-stone of any house and structure, the inner space, truth, etches, perfection, within the limits of human nature.

The Meta-narrative unfolds on the vault of the upper section of the <a href="http://cave3.org/venue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venue/Cave</a> cupola of figure 2, that is to say, on the 3 highest levels of consciousness of the sevenfold paradigm.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">The Theoretical Framework</h5>
The evolution of human consciousness, and of&nbsp;civilisation can be set, to the effect of this context, into seven successive stages as outlined below<a>4</a>, even though it is never safe to expect an exact parallelism between different paradigms portraying the evolution of human&nbsp;consciousness.
<a name="footnote4"></a>4. <a href="#start-footnote4">^</a> Some&nbsp;major features of this archetypical dimensional cosmology, based, among others, on the works of S. Aurobindo, J.G. Bennett, E. Corbin, J. Gebser, G.I. Gurdjieff, A. Maslow, M. S. Sumohadiwidjojo, P. Teilhard de Chardin, and K. Wilber, can be roughly summarised as listed below, taking well into account that each stage/phase is a dynamic pattern that receives, perceives, is permeated and actualises values percolated from the next evolutionary phase, yet latently present in the stage itself; that it broadens its own frame of reference by reconciling previously oppositions, and by shaping up a complex system of evolutionary ‘attempts’ aiming to forge the most fitting outcome to fulfil the proviso to transmute a quantum leap into its next stage; and that there is a distinction to be drawn between consciousness and awareness, as the former arises in partnership with matter and provides the reflective capacity, while the latter is identical with the Life-force of the underlying meta-universe and is characterised by unconditional knowing and wisdom.

Each stage indwells its own signature, or force, whose operative modality consists of specific characteristics. These stages are perceived as a sequence by a <em>linear</em> modality, yet in a quantum perspective, and in the human make-up, they are <em>non-linear</em>, nonlocal and co-existing, and in a non-linear manner they are performed in this work.
In <em>Cave 3.0</em>, these 7 stages of consciousness are freely integrated into 7 geo-cultural thematic areas, from which selected primary literary and theatrical forms are drawn, eventually to be performed, although not necessarily, in the following order:
<ul>
 	<li>South Asia – India: Hinduism, Buddhism, Tantra, Kathakali;</li>
 	<li>Southeast Asia – Indonesia: Sufism, wayang, silat;</li>
 	<li>Eastern Asia – Japan: Zen, Nôh, Butoh;</li>
 	<li>West Africa – Nigeria: Yoruba, Ifá, Egungun;</li>
 	<li>Northeast Africa &amp; Middle East – Israel, Turkey, Syria: Kabbalah, Hasidism, hora, Deka; Sufism, darkish, tatbir, Naqqâli.</li>
 	<li>Southeast Europe – Greece: Ancient Greece, mythology, Eleusis, tragedy;</li>
 	<li>South Europe – Italy, Spain: Fedeli d’amore, Commedia dell’ Arte, Opera, duende, flamenco.</li>
</ul>
Each area is seen as embedding a sub-narrative of daily concern (poverty, diversity, gender, rights, the environment, health and spirituality) depicting the complexity and beauty of human consciousness throughout all the ages, geographical areas, ethnicities, and cultural realms.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Project Description</h5>
<em>Cave 3.0</em> is a contemporary multidisciplinary opera in 2 acts, Prelude, 7 scenes, and Epilogue. The interval between the two acts is set between the 4th and the 5th scene, between the 4th and the 5th level on the 7th&nbsp;paradigm, marking a change in the narration tempo.
<em>Cave 3.0</em> is a unique artistic endeavour in that it integrates live performance and holograms<a>5</a> into a new whole advanced theatricality: the stage project combines live performers, music, singers, and dancers alongside&nbsp;hologram&nbsp;imagery as an integral part of the stage language. The use of holograms, combined with live performances, challenges the definition and the boundaries between film and theatre, between matter and antimatter, between sensory perception and illusion. Holograms appear as scenographic elements, as characters and objects, both concrete and abstract, movable and still, coming to life and vanishing as deemed necessary by the unfolding narrative. Herein, they are, and represent, the subtle aspect of reality, the “fifth wall” binding the performers to the audience and the symbol to the&nbsp;symbolized.
5. The hologram (Gr. <em>holos</em>, whole + <em>gramma</em>, that which is written) technology is an emerging craft and technique enacted by means of photographic and video projections to give rise to 3D imaginary. It is influencing human communication and visualization, while already opening up vast possibilities in the artistic field.
The libretto spans various planes of references, from daily and ordinary to aulic and symbolic language, gradually taking hold and integrating both the discursive strategy and the narrative trajectories in an intermedial relationship with music and the other semiotic fields. Performers and roles are interchangeable throughout the work, whose internal time of narration unwinds linearly from night to day and from void to fullness.
Each of the seven scenes is framed in a geo-cultural thematic area, portraying a distinct tier of the development of consciousness in each chosen culture, at times addressing and referring to archetypes drawn from traditional lore, and occasionally, quoting verses clothed into their respective theatrical forms.
The multidisciplinary and multimedia qualities of&nbsp;<em> Cave 3.0</em> represent an advancement of both the stage's aesthetic discourse and its fruition to an unprecedented noetic and experiential level, by thus creating an innovative operatic language.
