<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">He began his professional career as an artist in 1966 investigating the non-mimetic representation of symbols, which developed into reflections on art and the creative process. He was Associate Professor of Painting and Professor of Photography at the Fine Arts Academy (Rome, 1974-1979). In 1980 he took an interest in sustainability, the conservation of cultural heritage and the ‘book’ as an artistic expression. This led him to conceive of an innovative method of producing sustainable books and, in 1986, he founded the Semar publishing house to implement it. In 1989, he founded the international journal <em>Conservation. Culture &amp; Environment</em> and remained Editor-in-Chief until 1999.

In 2003 he established the Semar international unit in The Hague. In 2005, increasingly drawn to ethical business, cross-culture, intercultural and interfaith dialogue, development and systemic change, he established the Spanda Foundation in the same city.
From&nbsp;2016, while managing and carrying on the cultural and social work of the Foundation, he is elaborating and focusing on <em>Meeting in the Cave</em> his most recent artistic endeavour.&nbsp; In 2017, the systematization and the catalogue raisonné of his creative itinerary have begun, followed by the framing of the artist-endowed Sahlan Momo Foundation for cultural philanthropy and consciousness stewardship.
He is founder and Editor-in-Chief of <em>Musiké. International Journal of Ethnomusicological Studies</em> (2005 —) and of <em>Spanda Journal</em> (2007 —). His artistic works are in private and institutional collections (MoMA, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Frankfurt; National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome, amongst others); he has served as Chair and Member of several advisory committees for academic, research and scientific institutions; authored radio broadcasts, books and papers on art theory, spirituality, consciousness, development, and he has been the recipient of several national and international awards and honours. </span>&nbsp; <small><a class="external-link" href="https://sahlanmomo.org/bio-note/" target="_blank" rel="no opener noopener noreferrer">Website</a></small>
